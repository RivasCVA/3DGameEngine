# 3D Game Engine
A 3D Game Engine built using Java, Lightweight Java GL, and OpenGL. Followed the YouTube tutorial series from [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP). I learned about graphics libraries and the complex components that go into making a game engine.

# How to Run
I recommend using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) to run the project. You load up the project folder and hit the green run button.

# Disclaimers
All of the assets used in the project came from [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP). I claim none as my own. I followed the YouTube tutorial series so my project will resemble ThinMatrix's documentation.
