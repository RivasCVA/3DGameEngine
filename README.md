# 3D Game Engine
A 3D Game Engine built using Java, Lightweight Java GL, and OpenGL. I watched and followed the YouTube tutorial series from [ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP) on building a game engine. I learned a lot about graphics libraries and about many of the different complex components that go into making a game engine.

I all of the assets used came from the [ThinMatrix's YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP). I claim none of my own. As stated previously, I followed the tutorial series, so most of my project will be very similar to ThinMatrix's docs.
